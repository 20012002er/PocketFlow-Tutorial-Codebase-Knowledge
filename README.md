This project crawls GitHub repositories and build a knowledge base from the code:

- **Analyze entire codebases** to identify core abstractions and how they interact

- **Transform complex code** into beginner-friendly tutorials with clear visualizations

- **Build understanding systematically** from fundamentals to advanced concepts in logical steps

Built with [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework.
