This is a tutorial project of [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework. It crawls GitHub repositories and build a knowledge base from the code. It analyzes entire codebases to identify core abstractions and how they interact, and transforms complex code into beginner-friendly tutorials with clear visualizations.
